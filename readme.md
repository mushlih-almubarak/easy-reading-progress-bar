## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. Will this plugin slow down my site?
Absolutely not. Performance is a core feature. The plugin only loads its tiny, optimized code on single post pages.

#### 2. Does this work with my theme?
Yes, most likely! The plugin was built for high compatibility. It intelligently detects the main content area in both classic and modern themes.

#### 3. Can I change the height of the bar?
Yes. While there is no setting for it in the plugin's settings page (to keep things simple), developers can use a WordPress filter to change the height. The default is 7px.
Example code to add to your theme's `functions.php` file to change the height to 10px:
```
add_filter( 'erpb_bar_height', function() {
    return '10';
} );
```
